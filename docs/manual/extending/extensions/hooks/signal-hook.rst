SignalHook
==========

:py:class:`reviewboard.extensions.hooks.SignalHook` allows extensions to
easily connect to signals_ without worrying about manually disconnecting
when the extension is disabled.

To connect to a signal, the extension needs to instantiate
:py:class:`SignalHook` and pass in the signal to connect to, the callback
function, and an optional sender_.
