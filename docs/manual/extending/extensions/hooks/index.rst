Extension Hooks
===============

Extension hooks are the primary mechanism for customizing Review Board's
appearance and behavior.

Hooks need only be instantiated for Review Board to "notice" them, and are
automatically removed when the extension shuts down.

The following hooks are available for use by extensions.
