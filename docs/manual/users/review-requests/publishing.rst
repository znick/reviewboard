Publishing Review Requests
==========================

When you first create a review request, it will not be visible to anyone until
it is published. Click :guilabel:`Publish` in the green bar at the top to make
the review request public.

Depending on your particular setup, publishing a review request may send
an e-mail out to the reviewers, letting them know your change is ready to
be reviewed.


==================
Publishing Updates
==================

As soon as you make any change to a review request, a draft banner will appear
above the review request asking you to optionally describe your changes. This
is handy when you've actually uploaded a new diff and want to say what changed
in that diff.

When you're finished, click :guilabel:`Publish Changes`. If you decided you
didn't want to make those changes, you can click :guilabel:`Discard Draft`
instead.

Depending on your particular setup, publishing a draft may send an e-mail out
to the reviewers, letting them know your change is ready to be reviewed again.

The :guilabel:`Describe your changes` field supports rich text using the
:term:`Markdown` language. See :ref:`using-markdown` for more information.
