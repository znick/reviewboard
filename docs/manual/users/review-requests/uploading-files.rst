Uploading File Attachments
==========================

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Any type of file can be added to a review request. Log files, binaries, test
data, audio, or anything else. This is especially helpful for files that are
part of a change but can't be represented in diffs, as well as things like
attaching a screenshot of changes that affect user interfaces.

Many types of files, including text and images, can be displayed on Review
Board and reviewed by clicking on the areas where you want to add comments.
This works just like the review process for source code. Simply click the
thumbnail or click :guilabel:`Review` to begin reviewing the file.

Not all types of files have this support. For those files, clicking
:guilabel:`Add Comment` will let you leave a comment that applies to the whole
file.

See :ref:`reviewing-file-attachments` for more information.

There are two ways to upload a file attachment:

1. Click :menuselection:`Update -->Add File` on the action bar, browse for the
   file to upload, and optionally enter a caption for the file.

2. Drag the file from your file manager into the review request.

   When dragging over the browser window, a black overlay will appear,
   showing you where to drop the file to upload it.

   When you drop the file, the overlay will disappear and the file will
   upload.

   You can drag and upload multiple files at a time.

   Note that this requires a modern HTML5-capable browser, such as
   Google Chrome or Firefox 3.6+.
