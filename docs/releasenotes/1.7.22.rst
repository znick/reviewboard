=================================
Review Board 1.7.22 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: March 3, 2014


Security Fixes
==============

* An XSS vulnerability was found in the Search field's auto-complete.

  If a user had a first or last name with HTML in it, the HTML would be
  interpreted by the browser. This allowed crafting short scripts (up to
  13 characters in length per field, due to the field length limits).

  This release fixes the vulnerability.

  The vulnerability was made public on multiple channels, and we decided to
  fast-track a release in order to allow administrators to quickly patch
  their systems.

  :bug:`3274`


New Features
============

* Added support for anonymous access to public Local Sites.

  Local Sites marked as public can now be accessed by anonymous users,
  if anonymous access is turned on for the installation.

* Added support for parallel-installed versions of Django.

  Newly generated sites (or sites that update their :file:`reviewboard.wsgi`
  files) now function correctly if there are multiple versions of Django
  or another Review Board dependency on the system. The thread will ensure
  that Review Board will import the versions it's compatible with, and not
  other versions found on the system.

  Patch by Stephen Gallagher.


API Changes
===========

* The documentation for :ref:`webapi2.0-review-group-resource` no longer says
  that review groups cannot be created through the API.


Bug Fixes
=========

Install/Upgrade
---------------

* Fixed compatibility with Apache 2.4's method for authorization in newly
  generated config files. Patch by Stephen Gallagher. (:bug:`3210`)

* Fixed an issue on some configurations where loading in initial schema
  data for the database would fail. (:bug:`3126`)

* :command:`rb-site upgrade --all-sites` no longer throws an error if
  there are no valid sites configured. Patch by Stephen Gallagher.


Administration
--------------

* Administrators now have access to all repositories, instead of just public
  ones or ones they're a member of. (:bug:`3118`)

* Repositories backed by paths that no longer exist can now be hidden.
  Previously, attempting to change the "Visible" checkbox would result in
  an error. (:bug:`2361`)

* Fixed creating groups and repositories that had conflicting "unique"
  fields. (:bug:`3066`, :bug:`3093`)

* Password fields no longer appear blank when they have a value in forms.
  This prevents them from having to be re-entered just to save the form.
  (:bug:`3037`, :bug:`3167`)

* Setting ``https`` in the server URL now properly marks the server as using
  HTTPS. All URLs generated for the API and e-mails will include ``https``
  instead of ``http``. (:bug:`3085`, :bug:`3246`)

* Fixed incorrect labeling for the review request status graph in the
  Admin dashboard.

  The widget in the dashboard showing the percentage of all review requests
  mislabeled discarded review requests as draft review requests. This has
  been fixed, and proper support for draft review requests was added.
  (:bug:`3270`)


LDAP
----

* Usernames, passwords, and other information are properly encoded to UTF-8
  before authenticating. (:bug:`3256`)

* Users without e-mail addresses in LDAP no longer break when first
  authenticating. (:bug:`3257`)


Dashboard
---------

* Fixed support for accessing watched groups through the Dashboard.
  Patch by Thom Gerdes. (:bug:`3204`)


Repositories
------------

* Copied files in Git diffs no longer results in File Not Found errors,
  and properly handles showing the state much like moved files.

* Added better compatibility with Mercurial repository when accessing
  ``hg-history`` URLs, when the server name didn't contain a trailing
  slash. (:bug:`3216`)

* Added better CVS compatibility for repositories that don't contain
  :file:`CVSROOT/modules`. (:bug:`1986`)

* Fixed issues with Clear Case in multi-site mode when OIDs weren't yet
  available on the server. Patch by Nicolas Dély. (:bug:`3183`)
