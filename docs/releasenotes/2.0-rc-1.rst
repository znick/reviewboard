===================================
Review Board 2.0 RC 1 Release Notes
===================================

**Release date:** March 6, 2014

This release contains all bug fixes and features found in Review Board version
:doc:`1.7.22 <1.7.22>`.


Installation
============

To install this release, run the following::

    $ sudo easy_install \
        -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/ReviewBoard/2.0/ \
        -U ReviewBoard

We are very close to the final release of 2.0. If you are intending to run
2.0 on a production server, it is time to do some testing with this release to
make sure we address any bugs you may run into.

If you are careful with backups, you may run this on a production server, but
you may experience bugs. It is best to install on a test server first, in case
there are any major problems.


Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

**Make a backup of your database!**

Substantial changes were made to database migration. While our testing has
shown it to work, it *could* leave your database in a bad state.

Do **not** upgrade a production database without a full backup.

Please let us know if you have any problems with the upgrade.


Security Improvements
=====================

* This release fixes a vulnerability where users could compose a very short
  script in their full name fields and cause it to be executed when the
  user appears in a search result.

* Added improved CSRF protection to all our forms.


Usability Improvements
======================

* The name shown for the account menu in the top-right is now the username,
  and not the first name.

  This makes it easier to remember your own username, which is more useful
  than helping remember your first name.

* The list of columns on the Dashboard is now displayed in alphabetical
  order. (:bug:`3260`)

* Increased the size of the comment dialog.

  The comment dialog is now a bit larger, providing more room for writing
  comments and code samples.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Optimized the rendering of diffs.

  A series of optimizations were made to improve render time. Some operations
  are twice as fast as they were before.

  In particular, changes have been made to optimize highlighting of changed
  characters in "replace" lines.

* Reduced the number of database queries when loading extensions.


Web API
=======

* :ref:`webapi2.0-diff-list-resource` no longer thinks it can create diffs
  on review request without a repository.

  Attempting to create a diff on an attachments-only review request would
  result in an HTTP 500. It now returns an Invalid Attribute error.


Extensibility
=============

Authentication Backends
-----------------------

Populating Users on API Lookup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :py:meth:`AuthBackend.query_users` method was added, which can populate the
database based on a user lookup query.

This is called when querying :ref:`webapi2.0-user-list-resource` before any
results are returned from the database. This can be used to query a backend
server or database to fetch any matching users and store them in the database.

Patch by Mark Côté.


Extensions
----------

Access to Extension Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extension code often needed to access the instance of the extension, but that
instance wasn't always immediately available. That meant that they'd have to
jump through hoops, querying for the extension using the extension manager.

Extensions can now access an :py:attr:`instance` attribute on their
:py:class:`Extension` subclass, which will point to the running instance of
the extension. This will be ``None`` if the extension is not enabled.


SettingsForm.settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subclasses of :py:class:`SettingsForm` can now access a :py:attr:`settings`
attribute, which points to the extension's settings. This is useful for
custom :py:meth:`load` and :py:meth:`save` methods that need to access the
settings in some way.


AuthBackendHook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new :ref:`auth-backend-hook` allows extensions to provide new
authentication backends. These will be available in the list of authentication
backends that the administrator can choose from. This is now the preferred way
of adding custom authentication backends, rather than using Python
entrypoints.

The auth backend will be registered when the extension is enabled, and
unregistered when disabled.

See the :ref:`documentation <auth-backend-hook>` for information on using
this.


Extra Context for TemplateHook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`template-hook` now accepts an :py:data:`extra_context` argument that can
be used to populate the template with custom variables.

:py:class:`TemplateHook` subclasses can also implement
:py:meth:`get_extra_data` to dynamically generate data for the template.
Previously, they had to override :py:meth:`render_to_string` to provide any
custom data.


Bug Fixes
=========

Installation
------------

* Fixed generating lighttpd configuration files using
  :command:`rb-site install` (:bug:`3263`)


Diff Viewer
-----------

* Move detection will no longer show that a line moved to itself when
  making a whitespace-only change on a line.

* Move ranges can now span different types of remove groups.

  Previously, a move range would appear incorrectly when the moved-from
  range was spanning, say, a "replace" and a "delete" chunk. The new logic
  allows ranges to span any type of chunk, even "equal" chunks if it helps
  provide a good visual for the move.

* Fixed move detection for the last line in an inserted chunk.

  The last line wasn't being processed as a move unless the line after it
  was also moved, due to an off-by-one error.

* Newly introduced indentation changes between two diffs are now shown in
  interdiffs. They were previously filtered out.

* Fixed showing indentation changes when converting part of an indentation
  or unindentation from tabs to spaces.

* Fixed stylistic issues with line numbers and replaced text on move ranges.

* Fixed displaying the :guilabel:`Download Diff` link when using interdiffs.
  (:bug:`3269`)

  The link is now always shown when looking at a single revision, and never
  shown when looking at an interdiff.


Diff Parsing
------------

* Fixed some errors parsing unicode characters from diffs. This was
  a regression in the 2.0 betas, and affects all supported repositories.

* Fixed a Git diff parsing issue where we would sometimes try to read past
  the end of a file's diff.


Review Requests
---------------

* Fixed rendering Markdown file attachments or content in the review
  request multi-line text fields when they contain non-UTF-8 unicode
  characters.

* Fixed showing caption changes for legacy screenshots using the new
  change rendering from beta 3.

* Fixed some style issues when rendering Markdown file attachments.

* Posting a review request with a commit ID that matches an existing
  review request now works, and no longer results in a confusing error.


My Account Page
---------------

* Fixed problems saving profile information. (:bug:`3268`)

* The Groups list no longer shows any Local Sites you're a member of that
  don't have any review groups set up.

* Fixed some stylistic issues with checkboxes, labels, paragraphs,
  and e-mail fields.


Register Page
-------------

* Fixed a stylistic issue with the e-mail field.


Extensions
----------

* Fixed issues using static media bundles with :py:data:`apply_to`.


Other Changes
-------------

* Fixed a breakage when resetting your password. This regressed in an earlier
  beta.

* Logs containing timing operations weren't portraying microseconds correctly.
  This could lead to operations appearing to take longer than they really did.
