=================================
Review Board 1.7.21 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: January 14, 2014


New Features
============

* Added support for GitLab_ servers.

  GitLab is a popular self-hosted alternative to GitHub and other similar
  services. This release supports public and private personal and group
  repositories on self-hosted GitLab servers.

  Repositories on GitLab can be added through the Add Repository page.
  Simply select GitLab from the list of hosting services and fill in
  the fields.


* Added support for the Unfuddle_ service.

  Unfuddle is a service that provides Git and Subversion hosting, as well
  as numerous other features for project management and task tracking.

  Repositories on Unfuddle can be added through the Add Repository page.
  Simply select Unfuddle from the list of hosting services and fill in
  the fields.

* Added support for publicly accessible Local Sites.

  A Local Site can now be set to be public, allowing non-members to post or
  view review requests, or to participate in discussions.

  This is still experimental, and as a non-member, there are things users
  cannot do. For example, they will not receive e-mails for changes they're
  involved in, and cannot join any review groups on the Local Site.

Performance Improvements
========================

* Massively improved render time of large diffs,

  We made a change to our diff algorithm that should provide a substantial
  speed boost for large diffs. These could take some time to generate before,
  but now we cut short some of the calculations if they're deemed too
  expensive.

  In testing, this has dropped render time for some very large diffs from a
  minute to a less than 10 seconds.

  This will not affect existing diffs, only newly uploaded diffs. Please let
  us know if you see any regressions or breakages.


API Changes
===========

* Added new query parameters for filtering lists of repositories.

  The :ref:`repository list resource <webapi2.0-repository-list-resource>`
  now accepts the following arguments for filtering the list of repositories:

  * ``?name=`` - Comma-separated list of repository names.
  * ``?path=`` - Comma-separated list of paths or mirror paths.
  * ``?name-or-path=`` - Comma-separated list of strings matching either
    repository names or paths/mirror paths.
  * ``?tool=`` - Comma-separated list of registered SCMTool names
    ("Git", "Subversion", etc.)
  * ``?hosting-service=`` - Comma-separated list of registered hosting service
    names.
  * ``?username=`` - Comma-separated list of usernames for accessing the
    repository or hosting service account.
