=====================================
Review Board 2.0 Beta 2 Release Notes
=====================================

**Release date:** January 16, 2014

This release contains all bug fixes and features found in Review Board version
:doc:`1.7.21 <1.7.21>`.


Installation
============

To install this release, run the following::

    $ sudo easy_install \
        -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/ReviewBoard/2.0/ \
        -U ReviewBoard

We **do not** recommend upgrading a production server with this version of
Review Board. It's best to install on a test server, in case there are any
major problems.


Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

**Make a backup of your database!**

Substantial changes were made to database migration. While our testing has
shown it to work, it *could* leave your database in a bad state.

Do **not** upgrade a production database. Make a backup first of any database
you want to upgrade.

Please let us know if you have any problems with the upgrade.


New User Features
=================

Visual Refreshes
----------------

Review Request Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The layout of the information for review requests has been redesigned. There
are now two columns. The summary, description, and testing fields are on the
left, and all the other information is on the right.

This simplifies the view, shows more of the important information at a glance,
fixes up some confusing nesting issues, and will allow extensions to add new
fields.


Review UIs
~~~~~~~~~~

Review UIs now look a lot cleaner and more compact. In previous releases, a
mostly empty review request box would appear above the review UI, taking up
valuable space. This has been removed, providing more focus on the text,
image, or `PDF <http://www.reviewboard.org/powerpack/>`_ being reviewed.


File Attachment Thumbnails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File attachment thumbnails no longer appear scattered. They have a consistent
look and size. Long filenames and captions are ellipsized, and the delete
and pencil icons are now in consistent places.

The thumbnails now do a nicer job rendering the contents. Text files in
particular now have a better preview. The text contents are syntax-highlighted
in the thumbnail.


Login and Registration Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user login and registration pages were looking pretty outdated. The
redesign makes them much prettier, and extensible!

We'll be announcing some new extensions in the future that take advantage of
the redesign to allow for logging in with services like GitHub and Google.


Bulk Close for Review Requests
------------------------------

There's a new column available in the dashboard that provides a checkbox for
selecting rows of review requests. This allows for selecting one or more
review requests and closing them, right from the dashboard.

This is particularly useful for administrators, or users with close
privileges, to clean up review requests left open by other users.

You can find the new column by clicking the pencil icon on the upper-right of
the dashboard.

Review UIs
----------


Generic Text Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text files attached to review requests can now be reviewed just like a diff.
Their contents will be syntax-highlighted when possible, allowing for
easier review of standalone snippets of code, SQL data dumps, XML files, or
anything else.

Comments can be made on single lines, or they can span multiple lines. Any
commented lines will appear along with the comment in the review.

Enhanced Markdown Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Markdown file review UI has been updated to show both the source text and
the rendered results. Comments can be added to either source or text, and the
corresponding lines will appear in the review.


Other User Features
-------------------

* Added "Last Diff" timestamp to Review Requests.

  This change adds an additional timestamp to the top of the review request
  to show the timestamp of the most recent diff update.

  Patch by Vlad Safronov.

* The dashboard frame now takes up the full page size, instead of fitting
  the content and possibly scrolling parts off the page.


New Administration Features
===========================

Easy Search Setup
-----------------

The old and often broken PyLucene search backend has been removed. It's been
replaced with a new search using Haystack_ and Whoosh_. These are
pure-Python and should make sure much easier to set up.

Note that an existing PyLucene install will no longer be used. The new search
should work automatically, though, after doing a full re-index.

.. _Haystack: http://haystacksearch.org/
.. _Whoosh: https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/wiki/Home


Security Checklist
------------------

There's a new Security Checklist page under System Information on the side of
the administration UI. This will run through a series of tests and see if
there are any immediate problems you need to solve to tighten security on your
Review Board installation.

Over time, we'll add more checks to this. For now, it tests for your
``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting and for security problems with file attachments.


New Manage Extensions Page
--------------------------

The Manage Extensions page has been rewritten with the following features:

* Provides visual hints for enabled, disabled, and broken extensions.
* Extensions can be dynamically enabled or disabled without reloading the
  page.
* A new "Scan for new extensions" button updates the list of known extensions.
* When an extension fails to load, the error and traceback are shown with
  the extension, to help with debugging.


``condensediffs`` Management Command
------------------------------------

A new management command has been introduced to squash duplicate diff data in
the database. This can often result in a 50% or greater reduction in the size
of the diff tables.

To run the command, type::

    $ rb-site manage /path/to/site condensediffs

This may take some time, but you can continue to use Review Board while this
is working. A maintenance window is not required. It may, however, slow down
access to the database while working.


Better Feedback on Admin Changes
--------------------------------

When saving or otherwise modifying a database entry, or performing some
other action in the administration UI, you will now see a message confirming
what you did.

Note that the first time you view the administration UI, you may see many
messages from previous actions prior to the upgrade. This will only happen
once, and can be ignored.


Extensibility
=============

New Hooks
---------

Field and FieldSets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extensions can now add additional fields and groups of fields to review
requests through :ref:`review-request-fields-hook`
and :ref:`review-request-fieldsets-hook`.
See the documentation for more information on using these.

Custom fields will have their contents saved and published along with
drafts. They will also be shown in the "Review request changed" boxes.
Fields can provide custom rendering for their changed in these boxes
if they need to.


Template Hooks for Login and Registration Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are new ``before-login-form``, ``after-login-form``,
``before-register-form``, and ``after-register-form`` template hooks that
can be used to render content before or after the login or registration
forms.  This can be used to provide further instructions or other options.


LessCSS Files
-------------

Built-In Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any :file:`.less` file can now make use of ``@RB_MAJOR_VERSION``,
``@RB_MINOR_VERSION``, ``@RB_MICRO_VERSION``, ``@RB_PATCH_VERSION``,
``@RB_IS_RELEASED``, ``@DEBUG``, and ``@STATIC_ROOT`` macros.

These are useful in LessCSS macro guards when you may need to alter a rule
depending on the version of Review Board or whether it's a production
install.

Extensions can also use ``@STATIC_ROOT`` as the base path for loading in
definition files provided by Review Board. For example,
``@{STATIC_ROOT}/rb/css/defs.less``.

These apply to extensions when running in development mode and or when
packaging the extension.


Bundled Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LessCSS files can now import ``@{STATIC_ROOT}/rb/css/defs.less``, which
provides a number of definitions and macros to help match the style of
Review Board.


New ``extra_data`` Fields
-------------------------

``extra_data`` fields have been added to :py:class:`DiffSet`,
:py:class:`DiffSetHistory`, :py:class:`FileDiff`, :py:class:`Group`,
:py:class:`Review`, :py:class:`ReviewRequest`, and
:py:class:`ReviewRequestDraft`.

These fields accept structured Python data and serialize it to JSON.
They accompany the existing ``extra_data`` fields on
:py:class:`Profile` and :py:class:`Repository`.

Extensions can now store state on any of these objects for later use.
The values can also be accessed and manipulated through the API. See below.


Custom Login Instructions on Authentication Backends
----------------------------------------------------

Any custom authentication backend can now set ``login_instructions``
to the text to display on the login page. Installations that need
something beyond the default instructions can subclass their preferred
authentication backend and override these.


Signals for Loading Site and Extension Settings
-----------------------------------------------

There are two new signals that can be used by extensions to operate when
settings have been changed.

* ``site_settings_loaded signal`` (provided by :py:mod:`reviewboard.signals`)
  is emitted after Review Board loads its settings.

* ``settings_saved`` (provided by :py:mod:`djblets.extensions.signals`)
  is emitted for an extension when its settings have been saved.


Custom Context Processors
-------------------------

Extensions can now provide custom Django context processors, which will add
variables to all rendered templates. This is useful when you need to provide
data to pages not directly rendered by an extension, such as the login page.


Improves to Configuration Pages
-------------------------------

Configuration pages for an extension can now use the Django admin widgets that
are normally reserved for forms in the Django administration UI. These contain
useful widgets such as ``SplitDateTimeWidget`` and the side-by-side,
filterable lists of items.


Other Changes
-------------

* Moved the ``base-after-navbar`` template hook.

  This has now been moved to right after the navbar, instead of further
  down the page, allowing extensions to provide new UI immediately below
  the navbar.

* Custom middleware can now take an optional extension parameter.


Web API
=======

Improved Markdown Support
-------------------------

* Added support for forcing Markdown-capable text fields to show Markdown
  or plain text.

  Fields such as a review request's description or testing done may be
  in either Markdown or text format. Clients can now specify which they
  want to receive by passing ``?force-text-type=``. Valid arguments are
  ``markdown`` or ``plain``.

  When using ``markdown``, all Markdown-capable fields will be provided
  as valid Markdown, escaping the text if necessary.

  When using ``plain``, all Markdown-capable fields will be provided as
  plain text, unescaping if necessary. Any Markdown syntax (such as
  for links) will remain as-is.

* Added a ``text_type`` field for Markdown-capable resources.

  ``text_type`` shows the type of text used for all Markdown-capable
  fields in that resource. This will be either ``markdown`` or ``plain``.

  If using ``?force-text-type=``, this will reflect the type provided.

  This field replaces the ``rich_text`` boolean field introduced in
  2.0 beta 1.

* Added a ``text.markdown`` capability.

  :ref:`webapi2.0-server-info-resource` now lists ``text.markdown: true``
  in the capabilities list, allowing clients to make smart decisions
  up-front about Markdown support.


Extra Data for Resources
------------------------

Added support for accessing and manipulating extra data for many resources.

Various resources now support attaching and accessing extra custom data
through the API. By setting ``extra_data.custom_key=custom_value`` in
a request, the caller can set a ``custom_key`` that can later be accessed
when retrieving the resource.

Extensions can also make use of this data.

The following resources support attaching extra data:

* :ref:`webapi2.0-diff-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-diff-comment-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-draft-file-diff-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-file-attachment-comment-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-group-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-reply-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-reply-diff-comment-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-reply-file-attachment-comment-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-reply-screenshot-comment-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-request-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-request-draft-resource`
* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-screenshot-comment-resource`


Other Changes
-------------

* Added an ``absolute_url`` field to various web API resources.

  This field contains an absolute URL to the user-facing page that the
  content represents.

  This is available for the various file attachment and screenshot resources,
  :ref:`webapi2.0-review-group-resource`, and
  :ref:`webapi2.0-review-request-resource`.

  Patch by Edward Lee.

* Fixed a breakage when encountering errors looking up users in
  authentication backends. Patch by Crystal Lok Koo.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Reduced the memory requirements on the review request and diff viewer pages.

  The memory requirements have been dropped a fair amount compared to beta 1.

* Sped up publishing and discarding of reviews.


Bug Fixes
=========

General
-------

* Fixed the user info box to handle mouse motion better.

  The user info popup that shows up when hovering over a user's name wasn't
  very easy to use. It took too long to appear, and as soon as the mouse
  moved, it would disappear.

  It now appears quicker, stays open while the mouse is over it, and has a
  short delay before disappearing.

* Fixed some z-index issues throughout the UI.


Installation
------------

* Fixed a database evolution issue when upgrading to 2.0 beta 1.

  The ``repo_revision`` field for FileAttachments was too long in beta 1,
  which would cause some key length issues on MySQL when upgrading on
  some setups.


Markdown Support
----------------

* Fixed broken styles in the text editors, preventing the editor from
  rendering correctly.

* Fixed some issues with saving Markdown content.

* Improved automatic Markdown escaping when posting a change.

  It's no longer as eager to escape all Markdown characters. It mostly
  escapes only those that it knows will trigger Markdown processing.

* Fixed rendering of Markdown in e-mails.


Reviews
-------

* Fixed a regression in comment dialog dragging.

* Fixed the Publish/Discard buttons after replying twice.

  The buttons were staying disabled after saving a reply to a comment twice.
  They now re-enable themselves.

* Fixed the icon for the expand/collapse buttons on reviews.


Diff Viewer
-----------

* Fixed scrolling in the diff viewer when switching pages.

  The new diff viewer page implementation in beta 1 was not scrolling back to
  the top when switching pages.

* Improved the logic for move detection to not factor in whitespace when
  deciding on lines.

* Fixed a breakage when moving a line from the very end of a file.


New Review Request Page
-----------------------

* Fixed showing meaningful errors when failing to fetch files from GitHub
  for post-commit review.

  This can happen when GitHub's API is having problems, or the API is
  rate-limited.

* Fixed GitHub post-commit review when a commit deals with a file that
  doesn't have a patch associated.


Extensions
----------

* Fixed a breakage when building static media for extensions.

* If two extensions depend on the same third-party app, Review Board won't
  break if one of the extensions is disabled.

* The extension list API no longer breaks if an extension can't be loaded.
