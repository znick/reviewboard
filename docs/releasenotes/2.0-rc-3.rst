===================================
Review Board 2.0 RC 3 Release Notes
===================================

**Release date:** May 8, 2014

This release contains all bug fixes and features found in Review Board version
:doc:`1.7.25 <1.7.25>`.


Installation
============

To install this release, run the following::

    $ sudo easy_install \
        -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/ReviewBoard/2.0/ \
        -U ReviewBoard

We are very close to the final release of 2.0. If you are intending to run
2.0 on a production server, it is time to do some testing with this release to
make sure we address any bugs you may run into.

If you are careful with backups, you may run this on a production server, but
you may experience bugs. It is best to install on a test server first, in case
there are any major problems.


Important Upgrade Notes
=======================

**Make a backup of your database!**

Substantial changes were made to database migration. While our testing has
shown it to work, it *could* leave your database in a bad state.

Do **not** upgrade a production database without a full backup.

Please let us know if you have any problems with the upgrade.


New Features
============

Experimental Web Hooks
----------------------

* Added experimental "close-submitted" Web Hook support for Bitbucket,
  Beanstalk, and Google Code.

  Bitbucket_, Beanstalk_, GitHub_, and `Google Code`_ repositories can now be
  configured to close review requests referenced in a commit message (or
  identified by a commit ID) by using Web Hooks.

  To use this, configure a WebHook and provide the URL for the hook.

  For Bitbucket:
  :samp:`http://<server>/repos/<repo_id>/hooks/bitbucket/close-submitted/`

  For Beanstalk:
  :samp:`http://<server>/repos/<repo_id>/hooks/beanstalk/close-submitted/`

  For GitHub:
  :samp:`http://<server>/repos/<repo_id>/hooks/github/close-submitted/`

  For Google Code:
  :samp:`http://<server>/repos/<repo_id>/hooks/googlecode/close-submitted/`

  .. note::

    The 2.0 RC 2 release notes cover the usage of these hooks in more detail,
    though in RC 2, these webhooks were named "post-receive" instead of
    "close-submitted".

  Documentation on using these will be available at a later date. For now,
  the feature is experimental.

* "close-submitted" Web Hooks can now match by commit ID.

  The post-review Web Hooks for GitHub, Bitbucket, Beanstalk, and Google Code,
  which close review requests when commits are pushed, can now look up the
  proper review request through the Commit ID field, instead of requiring a
  URL in the commit message. This requires that the review request's commit ID
  field matches the resulting SHA1 of the commit.

  Patch by Anselina Chia.


Other
-----

* Improved the look of generated e-mails.


Extensibility
=============

Better Upgrades
---------------

Installing a new version of an extension will cause Review Board to re-install
all bundled media files.

This removes the need for administrators to disable and re-enable an extension
in order to get things working again.


Media Packaging
---------------

* Source media files (JavaScript, CSS, and LessCSS) can now be removed
  from built extension packages.

  This behavior can be triggered by adding the following to the package's
  :file:`setup.cfg`::

      [build_static_files]
      remove_source_files = 1


JavaScript
----------

* Improved support in ``RB.ReviewGroup`` and ``RB.Repository``.

  These resource models, used to communicate with the API, have been improved
  to better handle parsing payloads returned from the API.

* Added ``RB.DefaultReviewer`` for parsing payloads for the Default Reviewer
  API.

  This is not feature-complete, but can be used to fetch basic details on a
  Default Reviewer entry.


Sandboxing
----------

* Added sandboxing for several extension hook points.

  Many of the hook points Review Board offers now protect the rest of the
  application from crashing if an extension raises an exception. Currently,
  :ref:`review-request-approval-hook`, :ref:`navigation-bar-hook`,
  :ref:`comment-detail-display-hook`, :ref:`template-hook`, and the
  :ref:`action-hooks` are sandboxed.

  Patches by Edwin Zhang.


New Signals
-----------

* Added ``review_request_publishing``, ``review_publishing``, and
  ``reply_publishing`` signals.

  These signals are emitted before the publishing process starts on review
  requests, reviews, and replies. Extensions can connect to these to
  perform pre-publish validation. They can raise a ``PublishError`` to abort
  the publish.

  The error message provided to ``PublishError`` will be reflected in the
  API's error message.

  Patch by Mark Côté.


Authentication Backends
-----------------------

* Custom AuthBackends can now raise a :py:class:`UserQueryError` when
  looking up errors.

  These errors will be represented in the web API though
  :ref:`webapi2.0-error-226`.
