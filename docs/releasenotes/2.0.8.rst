================================
Review Board 2.0.8 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: September 24, 2014


Upgrade Notes
=============

* This release fixes some compatibility issues involving the newly-released
  Python-Markdown_ 2.5.

  Python-Markdown 2.5 does not work with Python 2.6. Users who have recently
  installed or upgraded Review Board on Python 2.6 may have noticed several
  error messages involving "importlib," which are due to that new release.

  Review Board 2.0.8 and higher now install Python-Markdown 2.4.1, which
  is compatible with Python 2.6.

* This release doesn't contain any new database schema changes.


.. _Python-Markdown: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/


New Features
============

* Clicking :guilabel:`Discard Review` in the Review dialog now prompts
  for confirmation. (:bug:`3300`)

  Patch by Justin Maillet.

* Added some enhanced debugging for incorrect review request issue counts.

  Some people have reported bugs when upgrading to Review Board 2.0.x
  where the issue counts shown on the dashboard were incorrect. We are
  working to track those down, and in this release, we've made it easier
  to provide debug information to us.

  A new ``rb-site manage <path> reset-issue-counts`` management command has
  been added, which will reset the counts for individual review requests, or
  for all review requests in the database.

  If you are encountering a review request with broken issue counts, please
  run::

      rb-site manage <path> reset-issue-counts -- --recalculate --verbosity=2 <id>

  Where ``<path>`` is the path to your Review Board site directory, and
  ``<id>`` is the ID of the review request. This will provide some debug
  information.

  If the count for that review request is still incorrect, please
  `file a bug report <reviewboard.org/bugs/new/>`_ with the output.


Web API
=======

* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-request-list-resource` now allows admin users to
  list all users' unpublished review requests. (:bug:`2766`)

  When querying this resource, pass ``?show-all-unpublished=`` to specify
  that all review requests, published or unpublished, should be shown.
  This requires the user performing the request to have full admin access.

  Patch by Ryan Done.
