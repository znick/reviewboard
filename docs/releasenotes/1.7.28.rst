=================================
Review Board 1.7.28 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: August 20, 2014


Security Updates
================

This release depends on Django 1.4.14 or higher, which fixes a number of
`security vulnerabilities found
<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/aug/20/security/>`_.


New Features
============

* Added the :command:`condensediffs` management command.

  Review Board 1.7.x introduced a new storage mechanism for diff data, which
  can cut down on the size of the data stored in the database. This new
  mechanism was used for newly-posted diffs, but old data was still in the
  previous format.

  Old diffs will now be migrated to the new format whenever they are accessed,
  or the entire database can be converted at once using
  :command:`rb-site manage /path/to/site condensediffs`.


Bug Fixes
=========

* SVN keywords are now handled in a case-insensitive way, preventing issues
  when keywords were added in all uppercase or lowercase.

* File attachment mimetypes are now guessed if the browser doesn't have a
  specific mimetype to show us, or sent us an invalid mimetype. (:bug:`2269`,
  :bug:`3427`)

* Administrators (or those with the
  :ref:`"Can Change Status" permission <can-change-status-permission>`) can
  now re-open discarded review requests. (:bug:`2989`)
