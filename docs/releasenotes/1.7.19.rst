=================================
Review Board 1.7.19 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: November 21, 2013


New Features
============

* Added support for two-factor authentication for GitHub.

  GitHub has support for two-factor authentication, which is a much more
  secure way of logging in to your GitHub account. Previously, Review Board
  did not support this when linking a GitHub account for new repositories,
  requiring that two-factor authentication be disabled first.

  Now if you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll be prompted for a
  token the first time you link an account. This token will be sent by GitHub
  to your phone over SMS or through an app, depending on your configuration.
  Enter the token, re-enter your password, and save.

  You only have to link your account once, as we make use of revokable OAuth
  tokens after the account is linked. If you already have accounts linked, you
  can safely enable two-factor authentication and not be impacted.

  Given the large number of attacks made on GitHub as of late, we **strongly**
  encourage you to `turn on two-factor authentication
  <https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication>`_.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Re-introduced browser caching on the review request page.

  The review request page has had a bug for a while where the browser's cache
  of the page would appear to be stale, due to a deprecated way of looking up
  the appropriate request headers.

  Now, loading the review request page subsequent times should use the
  browser's cached version, if the page hasn't changed on the server.


Web API Changes
===============

* Added the ``mirror_path`` field to
  :ref:`Repository Resource <webapi2.0-repository-resource>`.

  Patch by Edward Lee.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed the default focus on the Review dialog. The top-most field now
  always has default focus.

* Fixed LDAP authentication with LDAP servers that don't allow anonymous
  searches.

  Patch by Daniel Kan.

* Fixed displaying review requests for groups on a Local Site.

* Prevented rare crashes with Local Sites using the new permissions support
  without any granted permissions.

* Fixed HTTP basic authentication with the web API when using fastcgi.

  This only takes effect for new installs. For existing ones, you need to
  modify your Apache configuration to use::

      RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /reviewboard.fcgi/$1 [QSA,E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]

  instead of::

      RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /reviewboard.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]

  Patch by George Prekas.
